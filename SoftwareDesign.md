#Favorite Design Pattern:

- Facade seems like it would align with what I enjoy in programming. I prefer to do front end / UI development, so creating an interface to make a subsystem easier would be ideal or useful for me.

-Bleeding Edge: This could be related to problems I've ran into on this sprint. I was using Github to link my heroku app / go through the documentation, and then Github went down, and I had to find someone to give me their Readme so I could continue working, and remanage some of my work to use the heroku deployment.
